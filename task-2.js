/**
 * Task 2
 * 
 * You manage an e-commerce and you just introduced a new discount system.
 * 
 * You now want to display a message that tells customers the discount they used
 * and how much they need to pay after using the discount.
 * 
 * In case the discount is bigger than the price to pay, the message should display 0€ to pay.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * With an amount to pay of 100€ and a discount of 30€, the output message would be:
 * 
 * With a discount of 30€ you have to pay 70€. 
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * With an amount to pay of 20€ and a discount of 30€, the output message would be:
 * 
 * With a discount of 30€ you have to pay 0€. 
 * 
 * ------
 * 
 * Create 2 variables, `discount` and `cartTotal`, and assign 2 numerical values
 * of your choice
 * 
 * Create another variable `amountToPay`.

 * - this variable should be equal to 0 if `discount` is larger than `cartTotal`
 * - otherwise it should be equal to the difference between `cartTotal` and `discount`
 *
